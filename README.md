# DelphiDemo
This is my first Delphi application. It is a learning project for me to learn Delphi and apply programming principles I've learned from other languages. Those programming principles may not be appropriate, applied improperly, or left out completely due to still learning the Delphi programming language and application structure. However, it may help someone else move quicker through the learning curve for Delphi.

Anyone can use this code for any reason.
